# Mocks for developmnet

## Brief

The PP is developing as the API-first application so new features should be implemented in API layer at first.
Here is the place to store sources for all parts of the API development - Design, Documentation, Mock, Validation, etc.

## What tools do we use

- [Stoplight studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/) - for designing, bundling and linting.
- [Stoplight Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism/) - as mock and API validation proxy
- [Mockserver](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver) - as mocks host and data storage
- [Mockoon](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon) - Flexible GUI-based mock server
- [Postman](https://personal-portfolio.postman.co/workspaces/23c7f46f-2ca3-4514-8c29-bb3b8b3478e7/apis) - for testing
and some additional development, that is not available in other tools
